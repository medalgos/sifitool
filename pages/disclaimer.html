                    <p>MedCalc tools are designed to support clinical decision-making, not replace it. Healthcare providers should always exercise their professional judgment and consider individual patient circumstances when interpreting results provided by these tools.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Reference Sources</h3>
                    <p>While we strive to base all calculators on current clinical guidelines and evidence-based medicine, medical knowledge evolves rapidly. Users should verify that the guidelines implemented in these tools remain current for their clinical practice.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Accuracy</h3>
                    <p>Although every effort has been made to ensure accuracy, we cannot guarantee that these tools are free from errors. Users should verify critical calculations independently, especially when making important clinical decisions.</p>
